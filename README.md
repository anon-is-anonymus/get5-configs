# get5-configs
just a bunch of configs  

copy the links below and execute them using get5_loadmatch_url, do note that you must have steamworks installed  

```
get5_loadmatch_url raw.githubusercontent.com/anon-is-anonymus/get5-configs/main/B01.json 
get5_loadmatch_url "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anon-is-anonymus/get5-configs/main/B01.json"
```

^the above command would load the B01 match config file

# Pre Vetoed config
If you did your match Veto on paper/through discord etc, you can set get5 to use the map veto and map sides by setting "skip_veto" to true, setting "maplist" to the maps played (in order) and setting "map_sides" with "<i>team</i>_<i>side</i>" or "knife"
```
Pre_Veto_Example: raw.githubusercontent.com/anon-is-anonymus/get5-configs/main/Pre_Veto_Example.json
```

# Coaching config
If your match has coaches, you can specify how many and who can act as a coach in the match by setting "coaches_per_team" to whatever number of coaches you have. Within the "team" sections, add a "coaches:{}" section and add in the coach SteanID and nickname if you want to force one.
```

# ESL config
Config based off of ESL settings, though I recommend that you just dump the cvars into the get5 live config itself.

```

# A2B
I have config files created specially for A2B Esports. [Join them here](https://discord.gg/rTK6RHyecE). All files are in the A2B folder. I'm not taking requests to do custom match configs unless u feel like paying me lmao.
